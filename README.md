# Parser-Website
 Project of Languages &amp; Automata Theory Assignment.
 We created a lexical analyzer and grammar checker using parser based on web platform.
 
 The purpose of making this project is to understand how a PDA (Push-Down Automata) works,
 by implementing CFG (Context Free Grammar) theory using practical use of parser program.
 
 How is it work:
 This program made to get a string input from user and give an output of True or False by
 checking how the words typed and how the words are being arranged based on S-V-O grammar. 
 This program has a limited input of string and only works to some Swedish words that's available.
